Happy and healthy employees are the backbone of a great organization. As leaders are looking to improve their workplace, it’s important to have employee mental health be part of the conversation. How employees feel directly impacts their contribution in the workplace. A negative work environment is not only bad for employee morale, it’ll will cost you financially. In fact, the Center for Prevention and Health estimates that mental illness and substance abuse issues cost employers between $79 and $105 billion annually in indirect costs. Absenteeism, decreased productivity, and increased healthcare expenses are just a few of the way’s mental health problems cost employers.

There is a survey conducted every year from 2014 for the employees with a set of questions to answer and the answers are recorded for further study.

Using the survey information, we are trying to analyze the below problems:

1.	Mental health of the employees in different geographical area
2.	The frequent age group of employees who has mental health problem
3.	Employees who are aware of the mental health care options
4.	Is there a correlation between the company's support for helping those with mental health conditions and workers' willingness to reach out for help?
5.	Are smaller or larger companies more likely to provide people with mental health conditions?
